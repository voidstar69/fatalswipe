23/08/2014 (7.5 hours)
----------
13:45 to
14:10   Played around with a 2D sprite to figure out how to view it.
14:15   Added the new Unity project to SVN.
14:35   Added keyboard controls for sprite player. Player takes slow, measured steps (i.e. turn-based steps).
14:50   Experimented with script variables, changing them in MonoDevelop vs the Unity Editor. Killed MonoDevelop when it misbehaved. Created an 8x8 monochrome sprite.
15:10   Created another sprite. Added both sprites to Unity project. Created a Map object and script.
15:35   Got map script generating tile objects in a grid to form a visual map.
15:50   Created another sprite, and a tiny 3x3 map. The map is now displayed, although with gaps between tiles.
16:30   Enlarged tiles to remove gap. Made camera follow player. Created a new player sprite.
16:44   Created a new tile that is actually tileable across the map.
17:15   Added collision detection between player and solid tiles. Each tile can be marked as solid or not.
17:15 to
18:00   Went grocery shopping. Put pizza in oven.
18:10   Worked on map and tile artwork.
18:10 to
18:30   Ate pizza.
18:45   Inverted one tile's colour to make the background black, and made it tileable.
19:10   Setup two separate players, each with their own camera and map. For now they both move in sync on the same level layout.
20:00   Made some tiles walkable to one player but solid to the other player. Made right player's tiles render upside-down.
21:00   Made a lethal tile that kills either player, and a goal tile that transports either player to the next level.
21:00 to
21:20   Phoned Anna. Prepared cycling gear for tomorrow.
22:00   Added sound effects for player death and reaching the goal.
22:20   Added more levels. Changed logic so that both players die when one touches a lethal tile, and both must touch a goal to move to the next level.
22:40   Created more levels, including some introductory levels.
23:00   Created and play-tested more levels.

24/08/2014 (1 hour)
----------
19:50 to
20:05   Tried to workout the minimum I can work on to 'finish' the game for the compo. Commented out broken levels, and put levels into difficulty order.
20:05 to
21:45   Dinner, dessert and TV with Anna.
21:45 to
22:10   Created a trivial starting level, and a final level.
22:20   Removed the annoying background music.
22:50   Submitted to the Ludum Dare website, with description and screenshots.


POST-COMPO
==========

04/09/2014 (1 hour)
----------
20:05 to
20:15   Seemed to break the Unity project. Figured out how to load up the correct scene.
20:20   Darkened the background from white to grey.
20:40   Created new sound effects to replace existing warp and die sounds. Also created a walk and wall bump sound.
20:55   Added these sounds to the game, and tested them. Made the walk sound softer. Slowed down the walk speed so that the wall bump does not play too frequently.
21:00   Built a post-compo web build, and added it to SVN and Dropbox. Tested the Dropbox version online.

21/10/2014 (3 hours)
----------
19:00 to
19:10   Tested existing levels with an eye towards the level border preventing both avatars from moving.
19:30   Started coding super level border, but realised it requires syncing both players! Resorted to cloning some levels, with actual lethal tiles on the boundary.
20:10   Realised that the players start position is hard-coded. Created a tile char to represent the start, and made the players start at it.
20:10 to
21:00   Ate dinner, and tried to fix my Silverlight games on GameJolt!
21:10   Prevented diagonal player movement
22:00   Tested cloned lethal levels, and fixed levels that became impossible due to lethal tiles.
22:30   Built for Android and tested on my S3 phone.
23:00   Uploaded Unity web build to GameJolt, and tested it.
23:20   Attempted to upload Android build to Google Play store. Realised that build is signed with a debug key. Postponing to another day.

22/10/2014
----------
22:00 to

----------
09:30 to
09:50   Paused very slow anti-virus scanning, and started using ViewSonic monitor with laptop.

15:30   Added perma-death, resetting player to first level. Now also shows an advert after each death.
15:45   Trimmed first two levels down to smaller size to avoid boredom of swiping lots on levels without tension.
15:55   Increased touch sensitivity, so shorter swipes move player.
16:05   Fixed broken level D2 and integrated into game.
16:10   Changed background colour to black to match floor tiles.

TODO
----
Build better levels.
Change the game play to be more interesting.
Prevent player using level border to move other player? i.e. when one player collides with the border, neither player moves!
Artwork - make this less ugly!
